/**
 * The component interface <code>AdjustableCI</code> defines the standardised
 * operation that an equipment implements to let a household energy manager
 * adjust or suspend them <i>i.e.</i>, making their electric power consumption
 * the lowest possible.
 *
 * <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * An adjustable equipment is an electric equipment that can be suspended and
 * resumed, in which case it operates at the lowest possible level of power
 * consumption. In some cases, they may provide several distinct operative
 * modes that are designated by integers from 1 to {@code maxMode()} that
 * make it operate at increasing levels of power consumption.
