/**
 * The component interface <code>RegistrationCI</code> defines the
 * registration service of home energy managers that allows digital
 * electric equipments to register for their remote control.
 *
 * <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This component interface is part of a master course project aiming at
 * developing a mockup of a future home energy manager connected to a smart
 * grid.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The designed home energy manager requires a public component interface to
 * control digital electric equipments, but in practice, home energy manager
 * providers and equipment providers may not have the same interfaces.
 * The idea here is to also define a public XML schema that allows an equipment
 * provider to provide the home energy manager with a description of how to
 * make the link between the home energy manager required interface and its
 * own offered interface. The home energy manager can then generate a specific
 * connector that will accept calls following the required interface but that
 * will call the equipment respecting its offered interface.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This component interface is offered by the home energy manager and is meant
 * to be required by equipments that want to be connected to it.
